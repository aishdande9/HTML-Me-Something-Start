         <h3>BigSur</h3>
         <img src = "images/macOS-Big-Sur-Daylight-Wallpaper-iDownloadBlog.jpg" height="300" width="400">
         <p class = "funParagraph" id = "testP">Our First day was in BigSur,Big Sur is a rugged and mountainous 
            section of the Central Coast of the U.S. state of California,
             between Carmel Highlands and San Simeon, where the Santa Lucia 
             Mountains rise abruptly from the Pacific Ocean. It is frequently
              praised for its dramatic scenery. Big Sur has been called the 
              longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the
               contiguous United States",and we spent nice time there and we
                enjoyed food in there. </p>
               <h3>Caramel Beach</h3>
               <img src = "images/Carmel+-+by+-+the+-+Sea.jpg" height="300" width="400">
               <p class = "funParagraph" id = "testP">Caramel Beach was the hidden beauty we found at that drive while 
                  going to BigSur that was a private beach, it is the most beautiful scenic
                  beauty, we took lots of pictures over there and pacific ocean was too cold
                  and that beach was on the way to bigSur, on the way we saw many Mountains
                  and mountains were covered with fog and its was most beautiful sight and that 
                  place was extreme cold.
               </p>
               <h3>Yosemati National park</h3>
               <img src = "images/yose-main.jpg" height="300" width="400">
               <p class = "funParagraph" id = "testP">This National park is huge and i really didnt like the drive to this place 
                  the entire drive was ups and downs it was a hilly place, we went so early to that
                  place ,since we dont have reservation we had to wait till 4 pm ,because they are 
                  not going to allow people from 5 am to 4 pm with out reservations, there food was
                  not at all good, i generally dont eat beef, but by mistakely i had beef,and more over
                  the place was very beautiful that glacier was in pink color because of the sunset
                  and huge trees were very beautiful.
               </p>
               <h3>Lake Tahoe</h3>
               <img src = "images/luxe-vaca-lake-tahoe-scaled.jpg" height="300" width="400">
               <p class = "funParagraph" id = "testP">This place was heaven and this place was very far from where we stayed ,it took 3 hour drive,
                  but the journey to that place was very beautiful ,we saw the lake, the mountains and 
                  all the pine trees and it was most beautiful, we reached to that place at 4pm and it was too 
                  hot, the water was green in color and i thought of doing kayak but time was up we 
                   just spent time inside water and it was so beautiful and we took lots of pictures 
                   there.we celebrated my sons birthday over there it was really fun on that white sand,
                   the weather was so perfect at that time. 
                   
               </p>
               <h3>Golden gate Bridge</h3>
               <img src = "images/lUUnN7VGSoWZ3noefeH7_Baker Beach-12.jpg" height="300" width="400">
               <p class = "funParagraph" id = "testP">This is must visit place , i cant imagine how they constructed that bridge,that is so huge.
                  The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) 
                  strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California.
                  This place is too cold and it is very beautiful, we took so many pictures at this place,After visiting this place we 
                  walked on the streets of sanfransisco and we went to pier 39 to watch sea lions and we saw so many dolphins but 
                  it was very windy and i felt so cold at that place and i collected soveniers at that place , we liked sanfransisco 
                  a lot , we enjoyed nice food there.
